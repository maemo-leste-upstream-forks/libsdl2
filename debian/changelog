  [ Manuel A. Fernandez Montecelo ]
  * debian/control:
    - Updating maintainers/permissions:
      - Add myself and Felix Geyer
    - Update Build-Depends:
      - Remove a few obsolete items
      - Add items added lately to libsdl1.2, such as libts (touch screen)
        support
    - Add "libsdl2-dbg", analog to libsdl1.2-dbg
    - Change "XC-Package-Type: udeb" to "Package-Type"
  * debian/compat: set level 9
  * debian/source/format: Set to "3.0 (quilt)"
    - Remove README.source, not needed with new format
  * debian/sdl2-config.1: Fix typo, "progams"->"programs"
  * debian/libsdl2-dev.install:
    - Remove "usr/lib/*/*.la", discouraged
    - Add man pages: "usr/share/man/man3/*"
  * debian/libsdl2-dev.manpages: add file to install local "sdl2-config.1"
  * debian/sources: Removed, possible obsolete file from long ago?
  * debian/copyright:
    - Upstream updated to zlib/libpng
    - Copyright-file format conversion to 1.0
    - Complete revamp and detailed research about copyright and licenses used,
      it's very messy but hopefully complete

  [ Felix Geyer ]
  * Simplify debian/rules by using dh(1).
