Description: Do not propagate -lpthread to sdl-config --libs (adapted for SDL2)
 Introduced in 1.2.11-1 (Thu, 20 Jul 2006 14:17:18 +0200).
 .
 Upstream will not apply it at the moment:

 .
   At some point it was required that multi-threaded programs using pthreads on
   Linux link directly to the pthread library.  I don't remember all the details,
   but it had something to do with initializing C runtime variables correctly.
 .
   I'm sure it's not an issue anymore, but I'd rather not apply this patch in 1.2.
   I'll go ahead and make this change in 1.3 though.
